# pdf-upload-viewer

This project is a PDF Upload and Viewer application with a separate frontend and backend. 

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (https://nodejs.org/)
- npm (https://www.npmjs.com/)

## Frontend

The frontend is a React application located in the `pdf-viewer` directory.

### Installation

1. Navigate to the `pdf-viewer` directory:

    ```bash
    cd pdf-viewer
    ```

2. Install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Frontend

To start the frontend application, run:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

This will launch the development server and open the application in your default web browser.

## Backend

The backend is an Express application located in the `server` directory.

### Installation

1. Navigate to the `server` directory:

    ```bash
    cd server
    ```

2. Install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Backend

To start the backend in development mode, run:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

This will start the server using Nodemon, which automatically restarts the server when file changes are detected.

To start the backend in production mode, run:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

This will start the server without monitoring for file changes.
